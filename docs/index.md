## Introduction

* This datasheet will cover my portion of the project which includes the design of the motion detection system, the reasoning behind the selection of components and the project constraints.

### Project Summary

* Our goal for this project was to design a solution for a home product that includes a simple sensor and for each of the team members to have a working subsystem on a PCB-printed circuit board that will function together to make one cohesive product.
* For more information on our project as a whole you can visit our [team report.](https://egr304-team-205-2025-f.github.io/EGR304-2025-F-205.github.io/)


### My Contribution

* I was responsible for the motion detection which will be one of the three sensory inputs our light will detect to activate. The motion detection system will gather environmental data from the ultrasonic sensor and determine if the light should be in an on/off state and then communicate that to our control board.
