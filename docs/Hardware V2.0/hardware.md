## Overview
In this section I will discuss what would've been chnaged with the design of the hardware and why if I could redo it

## Improvements

To start I would have added more test points and leds for easier debugging, the biggest obstacle I faced during the process was not being able to identify what part of my subsystem was working. I would have also chosen a different photo resistor, most likely one with a higher range for more precision detection because my photo resistor was very inconsisten while it worked when the lights were off it would still remain on in lit rooms and needed extra light exposure to turn off. The last thing I would do differently is to choose a diffrent op amp to allow more space on my PCB for other heardware since my signal didn't need as much amplification as provided from the op-amp I used and it would have organizing my parts easier in KiCad.
